                AHH my love for this character and this series! I found this fit
                pic on pinterest and it just gave such Angel vibes I had to draw
                him in it

                I saw this hairstyle on pinterest and I needed to draw a character wearing it. You put anything heart shaped in front of me, I love. Simple.

                This is a bit of an older design when I was first messing around with Clip Studio Paint. I mainly use Procreate now because my iPad can't handle Clip sadface ;-;

              <p>
                I like making digital collages, they're fun and easier than real life collages. This one's based around an edited image of this opal that's carved like an espeon I own.

                This is one of those pieces that hit me in a strike of divine Creative spark. The character was overall heavily inspired by the fae creatures in Mahoutsukai no Yome, I was reading through that at the time.

                This character (and any sort of fawn/tiefling coded character) give me so much gender envy. I want horns so bad...
